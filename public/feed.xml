        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Added support for <code>startupTimeout</code> configuration for LSP servers</li>
<li>Added <code>WorktreeCreate</code> and <code>WorktreeRemove</code> hook events, enabling custom VCS setup and teardown when agent worktree isolation creates or removes worktrees.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where resumed sessions could be invisible when the working directory involved symlinks, because the session storage path was resolved at different times during startup. Also fixed session data loss on SSH disconnect by flushing session data before hooks and analytics in the graceful shutdown sequence.</li>
<li>Linux: Fixed native modules not loading on systems with glibc older than 2.30 (e.g., RHEL 8)</li>

<li>Fixed <code>/mcp reconnect</code> freezing the CLI when given a server name that doesn&#39;t exist</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak where completed task state objects were never removed from AppState</li>
<li>Added support for <code>isolation: worktree</code> in agent definitions, allowing agents to declaratively run in isolated git worktrees.</li>
<li><code>CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE</code> mode now also disables MCP tools, attachments, hooks, and CLAUDE.md file loading for a fully minimal experience.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where MCP tools were not discovered when tool search is enabled and a prompt is passed in as a launch argument</li>
<li>Improved memory usage during long sessions by clearing internal caches after compaction</li>

<li>Improved startup performance for headless mode (<code>-p</code> flag) by deferring Yoga WASM and UI component imports</li>
<li>Fixed prompt suggestion cache regression that reduced cache hit rates</li>
<li>Fixed unbounded memory growth in long sessions by capping file history snapshots</li>
<li>Added <code>CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT</code> environment variable to disable 1M context window support</li>
<li>Opus 4.6 (fast mode) now includes the full 1M context window</li>
<li>VSCode: Added <code>/extra-usage</code> command support in VS Code sessions</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak where TaskOutput retained recent lines after cleanup</li>

        <updated>2026-02-19T22:39:45.313Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Improved MCP OAuth authentication with step-up auth support and discovery caching, reducing redundant network requests during server connections</li>
<li>Added <code>--worktree</code> (<code>-w</code>) flag to start Claude in an isolated git worktree</li>
<li>Subagents support <code>isolation: &quot;worktree&quot;</code> for working in a temporary git worktree</li>
<li>Added Ctrl+F keybinding to kill background agents (two-press confirmation)</li>
<li>Agent definitions support <code>background: true</code> to always run as a background task</li>
<li>Plugins can ship <code>settings.json</code> for default configuration</li>
<li>Fixed file-not-found errors to suggest corrected paths when the model drops the repo folder</li>
<li>Fixed Ctrl+C and ESC being silently ignored when background agents are running and the main thread is idle. Pressing twice within 3 seconds now kills all background agents.</li>
<li>Fixed prompt suggestion cache regression that reduced cache hit rates.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>plugin enable</code> and <code>plugin disable</code> to auto-detect the correct scope when <code>--scope</code> is not specified, instead of always defaulting to user scope</li>
<li>Simple mode (<code>CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE</code>) now includes the file edit tool in addition to the Bash tool, allowing direct file editing in simple mode.</li>
<li>Permission suggestions are now populated when safety checks trigger an ask response, enabling SDK consumers to display permission options</li>
<li>Sonnet 4.5 with 1M context is being removed from the Max plan in favor of our frontier Sonnet 4.6 model, which now has 1M context. Please switch in /model.</li>
<li>Fixed verbose mode not updating thinking block display when toggled via <code>/config</code> — memo comparators now correctly detect verbose changes</li>
<li>Fixed unbounded WASM memory growth during long sessions by periodically resetting the tree-sitter parser</li>
<li>Fixed potential rendering issues caused by stale yoga layout references</li>
<li>Improved performance in non-interactive mode (<code>-p</code>) by skipping unnecessary API calls during startup</li>
<li>Improved performance by caching authentication failures for HTTP and SSE MCP servers, avoiding repeated connection attempts to servers requiring auth</li>
<li>Fixed unbounded memory growth during long-running sessions caused by Yoga WASM linear memory never shrinking</li>
<li>SDK model info now includes <code>supportsEffort</code>, <code>supportedEffortLevels</code>, and <code>supportsAdaptiveThinking</code> fields so consumers can discover model capabilities.</li>
<li>Added <code>ConfigChange</code> hook event that fires when configuration files change during a session, enabling enterprise security auditing and optional blocking of settings changes.</li>
<li>Improved startup performance by caching MCP auth failures to avoid redundant connection attempts</li>
<li>Improved startup performance by reducing HTTP calls for analytics token counting</li>
<li>Improved startup performance by batching MCP tool token counting into a single API call</li>

<li>Fixed <code>--resume</code> session picker showing raw XML tags for sessions that start with commands like <code>/clear</code>. Now correctly falls through to the session ID fallback.</li>
<li>Improved permission prompts for path safety and working directory blocks to show the reason for the restriction instead of a bare prompt with no context</li>
</ul>

        <updated>2026-02-18T20:15:11.998Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Fixed FileWriteTool line counting to preserve intentional trailing blank lines instead of stripping them with <code>trimEnd()</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed Windows terminal rendering bugs caused by <code>os.EOL</code> (<code>\r\n</code>) in display code — line counts now show correct values instead of always showing 1 on Windows.</li>
<li>Improved VS Code plan preview: auto-updates as Claude iterates, enables commenting only when the plan is ready for review, and keeps the preview open when rejecting so Claude can revise.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where bold and colored text in markdown output could shift to the wrong characters on Windows due to <code>\r\n</code> line endings.</li>
<li>Fixed compaction failing when conversation contains many PDF documents by stripping document blocks alongside images before sending to the compaction API (anthropics/claude-code#26188)</li>
<li>Improved memory usage in long-running sessions by releasing API stream buffers, agent context, and skill state after use</li>
<li>Improved startup performance by deferring SessionStart hook execution, reducing time-to-interactive by ~500ms.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bash tool output was silently discarded on Windows when using MSYS2 or Cygwin shells.</li>
<li>Improved performance of <code>@</code> file mentions - file suggestions now appear faster by pre-warming the index on startup and using session-based caching with background refresh.</li>
<li>Improved memory usage by trimming agent task message history after tasks complete</li>
<li>Improved memory usage during long agent sessions by eliminating O(n²) message accumulation in progress updates</li>
<li>Fixed the bash permission classifier to validate that returned match descriptions correspond to actual input rules, preventing hallucinated descriptions from incorrectly granting permissions</li>
<li>Fixed user-defined agents only loading one file on NFS/FUSE filesystems that report zero inodes (anthropics/claude-code#26044)</li>
<li>Fixed plugin agent skills silently failing to load when referenced by bare name instead of fully-qualified plugin name (anthropics/claude-code#25834)</li>
<li>Search patterns in collapsed tool results are now displayed in quotes for clarity</li>
<li>Windows: Fixed CWD tracking temp files never being cleaned up, causing them to accumulate indefinitely (anthropics/claude-code#17600)</li>
<li>Use <code>ctrl+f</code> to kill all background agents instead of double-pressing ESC. Background agents now continue running when you press ESC to cancel the main thread, giving you more control over agent lifecycle.</li>
<li>Fixed API 400 errors (&quot;thinking blocks cannot be modified&quot;) that occurred in sessions with concurrent agents, caused by interleaved streaming content blocks preventing proper message merging.</li>
<li>Simplified teammate navigation to use only Shift+Down (with wrapping) instead of both Shift+Up and Shift+Down.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a single file write/edit error would abort all other parallel file write/edit operations. Independent file mutations now complete even when a sibling fails.</li>
<li>Added <code>last_assistant_message</code> field to Stop and SubagentStop hook inputs, providing the final assistant response text so hooks can access it without parsing transcript files.</li>
<li>Fixed custom session titles set via <code>/rename</code> being lost after resuming a conversation (anthropics/claude-code#23610)</li>
<li>Fixed collapsed read/search hint text overflowing on narrow terminals by truncating from the start.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bash commands with backslash-newline continuation lines (e.g., long commands split across multiple lines with <code>\</code>) would produce spurious empty arguments, potentially breaking command execution.</li>
<li>Fixed built-in slash commands (<code>/help</code>, <code>/model</code>, <code>/compact</code>, etc.) being hidden from the autocomplete dropdown when many user skills are installed (anthropics/claude-code#22020)</li>
<li>Fixed MCP servers not appearing in the MCP Management Dialog after deferred loading</li>
<li>Fixed session name persisting in status bar after <code>/clear</code> command (anthropics/claude-code#26082)</li>
<li>Fixed crash when a skill&#39;s <code>name</code> or <code>description</code> in SKILL.md frontmatter is a bare number (e.g., <code>name: 3000</code>) — the value is now properly coerced to a string (anthropics/claude-code#25837)</li>
<li>Fixed /resume silently dropping sessions when the first message exceeds 16KB or uses array-format content (anthropics/claude-code#25721)</li>
<li>Added <code>chat:newline</code> keybinding action for configurable multi-line input (anthropics/claude-code#26075)</li>
<li>Added <code>added_dirs</code> to the statusline JSON <code>workspace</code> section, exposing directories added via <code>/add-dir</code> to external scripts (anthropics/claude-code#26096)</li>
<li>Fixed <code>claude doctor</code> misclassifying mise and asdf-managed installations as native installs (anthropics/claude-code#26033)</li>
<li>Fixed zsh heredoc failing with &quot;read-only file system&quot; error in sandboxed commands (anthropics/claude-code#25990)</li>
<li>Fixed agent progress indicator showing inflated tool use count (anthropics/claude-code#26023)</li>
<li>Fixed image pasting not working on WSL2 systems where Windows copies images as BMP format (anthropics/claude-code#25935)</li>
<li>Fixed background agent results returning raw transcript data instead of the agent&#39;s final answer (anthropics/claude-code#26012)</li>
<li>Fixed Warp terminal incorrectly prompting for Shift+Enter setup when it supports it natively (anthropics/claude-code#25957)</li>
<li>Fixed CJK wide characters causing misaligned timestamps and layout elements in the TUI (anthropics/claude-code#26084)</li>
<li>Fixed custom agent <code>model</code> field in <code>.claude/agents/*.md</code> being ignored when spawning team teammates (anthropics/claude-code#26064)</li>
<li>Fixed plan mode being lost after context compaction, causing the model to switch from planning to implementation mode (anthropics/claude-code#26061)</li>
<li>Fixed <code>alwaysThinkingEnabled: true</code> in settings.json not enabling thinking mode on Bedrock and Vertex providers (anthropics/claude-code#26074)</li>
<li>Fixed <code>tool_decision</code> OTel telemetry event not being emitted in headless/SDK mode (anthropics/claude-code#26059)</li>
<li>Fixed session name being lost after context compaction — renamed sessions now preserve their custom title through compaction (anthropics/claude-code#26121)</li>
<li>Increased initial session count in resume picker from 10 to 50 for faster session discovery (anthropics/claude-code#26123)</li>
<li>Windows: fixed worktree session matching when drive letter casing differs (anthropics/claude-code#26123)</li>
<li>Fixed <code>/resume &lt;session-id&gt;</code> failing to find sessions whose first message exceeds 16KB (anthropics/claude-code#25920)</li>
<li>Fixed &quot;Always allow&quot; on multiline bash commands creating invalid permission patterns that corrupt settings (anthropics/claude-code#25909)</li>
<li>Fixed React crash (error #31) when a skill&#39;s <code>argument-hint</code> in SKILL.md frontmatter uses YAML sequence syntax (e.g., <code>[topic: foo | bar]</code>) — the value is now properly coerced to a string (anthropics/claude-code#25826)</li>
<li>Fixed crash when using <code>/fork</code> on sessions that used web search — null entries in search results from transcript deserialization are now handled gracefully (anthropics/claude-code#25811)</li>
<li>Fixed read-only git commands triggering FSEvents file watcher loops on macOS by adding --no-optional-locks flag (anthropics/claude-code#25750)</li>
<li>Fixed custom agents and skills not being discovered when running from a git worktree — project-level <code>.claude/agents/</code> and <code>.claude/skills/</code> from the main repository are now included (anthropics/claude-code#25816)</li>
<li>Fixed non-interactive subcommands like <code>claude doctor</code> and <code>claude plugin validate</code> being blocked inside nested Claude sessions (anthropics/claude-code#25803)</li>
<li>Windows: Fixed the same CLAUDE.md file being loaded twice when drive letter casing differs between paths (anthropics/claude-code#25756)</li>
<li>Fixed inline code spans in markdown being incorrectly parsed as bash commands (anthropics/claude-code#25792)</li>

<li>Fixed sessions with large first prompts (&gt;16KB) disappearing from the /resume list (anthropics/claude-code#26140)</li>
<li>Fixed shell functions with double-underscore prefixes (e.g., <code>__git_ps1</code>) not being preserved across shell sessions (anthropics/claude-code#25824)</li>
<li>Fixed spinner showing &quot;0 tokens&quot; counter before any tokens have been received (anthropics/claude-code#26105)</li>
<li>VSCode: Fixed conversation messages appearing dimmed while the AskUserQuestion dialog is open (anthropics/claude-code#26078)</li>
<li>Fixed background tasks failing in git worktrees due to remote URL resolution reading from worktree-specific gitdir instead of the main repository config (anthropics/claude-code#26065)</li>
<li>Fixed Right Alt key leaving visible <code>[25~</code> escape sequence residue in the input field on Windows/Git Bash terminals (anthropics/claude-code#25943)</li>

<li>Fixed a regression where Windows users with a <code>.bashrc</code> file could not run bash commands</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>

<li>Fixed security vulnerability where wildcard permission rules could match compound commands containing shell operators</li>
<li>Fixed false &quot;file modified&quot; errors on Windows when cloud sync tools, antivirus scanners, or Git touch file timestamps without changing content</li>
<li>Fixed orphaned tool_result errors when sibling tools fail during streaming execution</li>
<li>Fixed context window blocking limit being calculated using the full context window instead of the effective context window (which reserves space for max output tokens)</li>

When MCP tool descriptions exceed 10% of the context window, they are automatically deferred and discovered via the MCPSearch tool instead of being loaded upfront. This reduces context usage for users with many MCP tools configured. Users can disable this by adding <code>MCPSearch</code> to <code>disallowedTools</code> in their settings.</li>
